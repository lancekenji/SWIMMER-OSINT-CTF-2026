# SWIMMER OSINT CTF 2026 - Writeups

Hi, I’m **mis4nthr0pia** from team **Lil:Pwny** — a computer science student and cybersecurity enthusiast based in the Philippines with a strong interest in Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT).

This GitBook contains my **SWIMMER OSINT CTF 2026 writeups**, documenting **only the challenges I personally solved**. In each writeup, I explain how I approached problems that rely on visual analysis, geolocation, and contextual reasoning rather than automation or exploitation. The focus is on how publicly available information—especially images and geographic clues—can be carefully analyzed and correlated to reach accurate conclusions.

My main interests lie in **GEOINT**, I**MINT/Image-based OSINT**, and **context-driven investigations**. I enjoy challenges that seem simple at first glance but require attention to detail, spatial awareness, and real-world reasoning once you start breaking down the clues.

### 🧭 OSINT Focus & Approach

The challenges documented here are approached with a **strictly passive OSINT mindset**:

* No interaction with real people or accounts
* No operational use of findings
* No automation or intrusive techniques

Instead, I focus on:

* Visual clue extraction from images
* Landmark, terrain, and environmental analysis
* Map-based reasoning and location narrowing
* Cross-referencing context, time, and geography

### 📚 What You’ll Find Here

* Step-by-step OSINT CTF writeups
* GEOINT and ImageINT reasoning processes
* Visual clue breakdowns and hypothesis testing
* Source validation and logical elimination
* Lessons learned from each challenge

These notes are written both as a personal knowledge archive and as a way to contribute back to the OSINT and CTF community.
